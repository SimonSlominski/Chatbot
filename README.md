# Chatbot
Build chatbot using Deep Natural Language Processing models in Tensorflow and Python

## Overview
If youâ€™ve ever used customer support livechat service, have you ever wonder with who are you actually chatting? 

By 2020, Gartner estimates that chatbots will be handling 85 percent of customer-service interactions; they are already handling about 30 percent of transactions now. (Last update 11/2018)

## Requirements
1. Python 3.5
2. Tensorflow
3. Numpy

## Running the script
To run the chatbot, run all code from the begining to **Part 3 - Training the Seq2seq model**. After that, you will obtained the training file **'chatbot_weights.ckpt'**. 

Training chatbot may take several days (+/- 5 days) depending on the power of the computer you are working on (CPU/GPU). It is also possible to use virtual machines (eg AWS), but this option is not free.

After that, to run the chatbot (eg in Spider terminal), run all code without "Part 3 - Training the Seq2seq model". Then you will be able to talk with your chatbot.
